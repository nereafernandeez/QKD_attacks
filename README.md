These programs where created for my final project of uni called "Attacks on QKD protocols". The project is pretty cool. 

1) I simulated the BB84 protocol, a PNS attack to said protocol, and a decoy state protocol as a way to identify the PNS attack. 
2) I simulated the SARG04 protocol and the consequences of a THA attack.

The code is commented but the comments are in spanish since I don't expect a single soul to read these programs (except probably my mom), but a girl can dream.
I could, in fact, translate them, but only if I see SOMEONE, literally ANYBODY, reading or needing the code. Otherwise, it will stay as it is :)

Anyway, about the programs. There are two different programs for each simulation: one of them is the code for a simulation on a classic computer. The other 
one is the exact same simulation but with the code adapted so it can run in one of the IBM online quantum computers. I used Qiskit 1.2.4.

I think that is all you need to know. I'll probably upload my written project here, but again, in spanish (yeah, I know, I'm being lazy, but as I said, I think
my mom is the only one who is actually going to read it, and we are spanish, so the you go) If I actually see the need to translate it I will, I don't mind THAT much.
