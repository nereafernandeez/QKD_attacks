These programs were created for my final project of uni called "Attacks on QKD protocols".

1) I simulated the BB84 protocol, a PNS attack, and a decoy state protocol as a way to identify the PNS attack. 
2) I simulated the SARG04 protocol and the consequences of a THA attack.

The code is commented but the comments are in Spanish since I don't expect a single soul to read these programs (except probably my mom and dad).
I could, in fact, translate them, but only if I see someone, literally ANYBODY, reading or needing the code. Otherwise, it will stay as it is :)

Anyway, about the programs. There are two different programs for each simulation: one of them is the code for a simulation on a classical computer. The other 
one is the exact same simulation but with the code adapted so it can run on one of the IBM online quantum computers. I used Qiskit 1.2.4.

I think that is all you need to know. I'll probably upload my written project here, but again, in Spanish (yeah, I know, I'm being lazy, but as I said, I think
my parents are the only ones who are actually going to read it, and we are Spanish, so the you go) If I actually see the need to translate it I will, I don't mind THAT much.
